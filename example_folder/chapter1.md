# Chapter 1

This is the *italic text* example.

This is the **bold text** example.

This is ***bold and italic together***.

This is a sentence with *italic*, **bold**, and ***both*** mixed inline.

## Subheading A

Normal paragraph text for testing.  
You can also try multiple lines to see how wrapping behaves.

### Subheading A.1

Here is a code block:

```
def hello():
    print("Hello from code block")
```

And here is another one with different content:

```
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

## Mixed Content

A paragraph with **bold**, then a code block, then *italic*, then an image:

```
x = 42
y = x * 2
print(y)
```

End of test file.
